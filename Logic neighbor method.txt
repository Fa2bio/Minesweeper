| (1,1) | (1,2) | (1,3) |
| (2,1) | (2,2) | (2,3) |
| (3,2) | (3,2) | (3,3) |

point (2,2) is in side neighbor to point (2,3) |(2-3) + (2-2)| = |-1| = 1
point (2,2) is in diagonally neighbor to point (3,3) |(2-3) + (2-3)| = |-1-1| = |-2| = 2	

There are two possibilities of valid neighbors: the neighbor is on the side OR the neighbor is diagonally. We check that the neighbor is not in the
same row and not in the same column. If it's not in the same row AND it's not in the same column, then diagonal is possible.

If the field is a neighbor to the side, then the modulus of the distance is equal to one. If the field is a diagonal neighbor, the modulus of the 
distance is equal to two. If the distance modulus is different from one OR two, the field cannot be added because it is not a valid neighbor.
